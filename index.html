      This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy. The most accurate classification model from a heterogeneous
      classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch. Our goal is to achieve greater incremental improvement in accuracy, compared
      to using a single type of classification model throughout the process. The strategy is evaluated on benchmark data sets.
      We further consider an application to texture classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with non-adaptive
      active learning and traditional machine learning approaches. Our results show that...We conclude that...

      In today’s technologically advancing era, AI and machine learning are transforming almost every field, from healthcare to manufacturing (Why is AI Important? 2021). But what exactly is AI, and how is it different from machine learning? As defined by McCarthy, AI is the science of engineering intelligent machines that are able to perform human-like cognitive functions (McCarthy, 2007). While machine learning, a subset AI, focuses on teaching it to learn independently from data patterns (Machine learning: What it is and why it matters). It is machine learning that allows AI to excel in sectors like healthcare and banking (Why is AI important? 2021). In this article, we will dive into how AI learns and develops from data, and the role machine learning plays in this process.

        As shown in Negnevitsky’s book, the science of Artificial Intelligence has had quite a history
      over the decades. Mainly being founded by three generations of researchers. The first was
      Alan Turing, who proposed the ‘Turing test’ as a standard to determine whether an artificial
      computer is thinking (Copeland). Then came McCulloch whose research on the central
      nervous system resulted in a model of neurons in the brain – the first major contribution to
      AI, and later John Von Neumann who helped build the first neural network computer
      (Negnevitsky, 2020).
